<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Jun</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->


<div class="hero-image">
  <div class="hero-text">
      <h1>I am Jun!</h1>
      <h2>University of Pittsburgh</h2>

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a second year student at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm majoring in neuroscience, minoring in theater arts, and pursuing a certificate in public communication of science and technology. I knew I wanted to study neuroscience since high school, but theater arts and writing are my newly discovered passions! I never knew I enjoyed theater arts or writing until I came to college and took relevant classes. This semester, I am taking intro to neuroscience, organic chemistry 2, organic chemistry lab, biology 2 lab, a world theater class, and this class (ENGCMP 0520)!</h3>
  </div>



<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->


<img src="jun.jpg" alt="a picture of me smiling" class="center-img" style="width:50%;"></img>


<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
  <h3>I like to consider myself as a writer. Even though I'm not the best at it, I enjoy writing! I am however far from being a designer or a maker. I have never been taught about the media or design, which is one of the reasons why I'm taking this class - to learn! I don't have much knowledge in this field so I don't have any specific skills that I want to learn, but I am hoping that this class will introduce me into the world of design.</h3>
</div>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
  <h3>Again, I severely lack knowledge in the field of design, so I don't have specific design interests. As a beginner in the field though, I assume that "good design" is something that attracts the audience by being visually appealing and organized. For example, I think Apple products are very well-designed. I think they're visually pleasing, especially in terms of their color selection and minimalistic looks. I also know that a lot of people are attracted to Apple products because of their fantasic design. This demonstrates why good design is so important; it can connect to the audience and motivate them to look more into the displayed product!</h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
   <h3>After college, I would like to pursue a career in research and/or teaching. I am not too sure about what specifically I want to research about, but my interests include a bunch of topics in neuroscience, toxicology, and pharmacology. I work as a research assistant in a lab and I truly enjoy the work I am doing there. I am interested in research because the idea of studying and possibly answering the unknown intrigues me. I am also interested in teaching because I've had such great experiences with my teachers and mentors, and because I would love to hold such meaningful impact on people's educational journey. I think both my parents having a background in education definitely affected me, though! This class will help me explore new fields and possibly find something to add on to my never-ending list of interests. </h3>
